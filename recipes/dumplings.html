        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Trust me when I say, these pan-fried pork dumplings with cabbage and asian chives are better than your average takeout potstickers! The filling is tender and juicy while the bottoms are crispy. Whether you eat them on their own, dip them in our soy and vinegar dumpling sauce, or dress them with some chili oil, you'll love them!

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>4 tbsp asian chives</li>
                <li>2 parts pork belly</li>
                <li>1 part lean porn</li>
                <li>1tbsp Shaoxing rice wine</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Place about 1 tablespoon of filling on the center of the wrapper and lightly dab some water along the edges of the entire wrapper. *As you get more practice pleating dumplings, you can add more filling to your dumpling.*
                </li>
                <li>
                    Fold the wrapper in half like a taco and pinch one end of the wrapper to seal. That is where you will start pleating. Using your forefingers, make a backward "s," then pinch and seal. Repeat this motion all the way across the dumpling. Some people prefer using their thumbs instead, so feel free to find what's comfortable for you.
                </li>
                <li>
                    At the end of the pleat, simply pinch the wrapper together to seal the dumpling. Try to leave spaces in the dumpling to prevent air bubbles. Air bubbles will expand when the dumplings are cooking and can break the seal.

                </li>
                <li>
                    Lastly, as a precaution, I like to go back over the pleats and give the folds an extra pinch to make sure the filling is sealed. This will prevent our juicy filling from leaking and losing flavor.
