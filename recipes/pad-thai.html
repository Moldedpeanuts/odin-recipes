            If you’re like me, you’ve spent many a Saturday night with friends, beers in hand, surrounded by half a dozen take-out containers of red curry, green papaya salad, pad see ew, and my personal favorite, pad Thai. It’s always a must-order, which is why it’s especially disappointing to get a lackluster one. Not to worry—your days of too-sweet sauce, gummy noodles, or overcooked protein are over. With just a few special ingredients, you can make this subtly sweet, tangy, nutty, and salty Thai dish, right at home, exactly how you like it.
