                <li>2 Tbsp. hoisin sauce</li>
                <li>2 Tbsp. reduced-sodium soy sauce</li>
                <li>2 Tbsp. sweet chili sauce</li>
                <li>1 Tbsp. apple cider vinegar</li>
                <li>1 Tbsp. brown sugar</li>
                <li>Juice of 1/2 lemon</li>
                <li>2 scallions, thinly sliced</li>
                <li>Cooked white rice, for serving</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    In a shallow bowl, beat eggs until blended. In another shallow bowl, mix flour and 1/2 cup cornstarch; season with salt and black pepper. Coat chicken in egg, then toss in flour mixture, tapping off any excess.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Into a large, deep skillet, pour oil to a depth of 1/4". Heat until shimmering and a piece of chicken sizzles when added. Working in batches, fry chicken until golden brown and crispy, 4 to 5 minutes. Drain on a paper towel-lined plate.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In a medium saucepan over medium heat, heat 1 tablespoon oil. Add garlic, ginger, and red pepper and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Whisk in orange juice, hoisin sauce, soy sauce, chili sauce, vinegar, brown sugar, and lemon juice and bring to a simmer.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Meanwhile, in a small bowl, whisk remaining 1 tablespoon cornstarch with 2 tablespoons water. Slowly whisk into sauce to thicken and simmer, stirring occasionally, until sauce is syrupy, about 5 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Transfer chicken to a platter. Add sauce, toss to combine, and top with scallions. Serve over rice.
