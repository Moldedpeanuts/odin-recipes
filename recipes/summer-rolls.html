            If you’re looking for the perfect light appetizer or summer lunch, then turn to these homemade summer rolls. For my recipe, I rolled gently poached shrimp, springy rice noodles, crunchy vegetables, and fresh green herbs into al dente rice paper sheets. Paired with an easy peanut dipping sauce, these summer rolls are the refreshing (and versatile!) dish I turn to again and again when I need something quick, easy, and oh so satisfying. Skip going out—make these summer rolls right at home instead.
