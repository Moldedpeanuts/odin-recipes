                            For me, cooking is all about balance-fueling my body, while also enjoying food that feels like home. And of course, capturing it all through the lens</p>
                        <p>
                            Nordic food is more than just tradition. Whether im recreating classing Norwegian dishes or discovering new flavors from different corners of the globe, i bring my love for photography to every meal i make.Join me on this journey, where food, photography, and adventure come together to tell a story thatâ€™s as vibrant and nourishing as the meals themselves.
