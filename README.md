# Nordic Recipes Blog

A clean and minimalistic **Nordic food blog** in the making - currently built with basic HTML and CSS. The goal of this project is to lay the foundation for a fully functioning recipe website focused on authentic and modern Nordic cuisine. Future plans include dynamic content, interactive features and a full-stack build.
